Module 4 Pandas Challenge

This is the PyCitySchools & PyBank challenge.

Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the local government area's key metrics in a DataFrame.
Include the following:
Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarises key metrics about each school.
Include the following:
School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".

Maths Scores by Year
Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average maths score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

Reading Scores by Year
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each year level (9, 10, 11, 12) at each school.

Scores by School Spending
Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).
Use the scores above to create a DataFrame called spending_summary.
Include the following metrics in the table:
Average maths score
Average reading score
% passing maths (the percentage of students who passed maths)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed maths AND reading)

Scores by School Size
Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".

Scores by School Type

Use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called type_summary.
This new DataFrame should show school performance based on the "School Type".
